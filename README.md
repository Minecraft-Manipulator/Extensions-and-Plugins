# Extensions-and-Plugins
One place for all of the extensions and plugins for the Minecraft Manipulator tool. 

Please note that this repository is still in progress and will be updated shortly. Currently, the developers' focus is on the main repository for the main tool. This repository will be updated once the main software is closer to completion.

The official repository for Minecraft Manipulator extensions and plugins is here. All extensions and plugins are offered as they are and without any promises of future updates or support. If you want to report bugs or ask about a specific extension/plugin, go to its repository or join the Discord Server.

The Minecraft Manipulator offers pre-installed extensions and plugins developed by its creators for the best user experience. But that's not all. The Minecraft Manipulator is unique in that it also supports extensions and plugins from other tools. Yes, thatâ€™s right! All of the extensions/plugins from tools including the Universal Minecraft Tool and the Amulet Editor work flawlessly with the Minecraft Manipulator. This makes it incredibly easy for developers to create and transfer their extensions to the Minecraft Manipulator.
